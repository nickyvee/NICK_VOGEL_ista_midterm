I guess if I was going to write a program in which two people had to race eachother with mouse clicks it would be something like this:

background(800,600)
fill(0)
draw line (down middle)
display (integer at top left)
display (integer at top right)


if (space-bar) pressed,
   then +1 to integer top right;

if (mouse-click) pressed,
   then +1 to integer top left;

if integer = 50 show explosion, display winner
